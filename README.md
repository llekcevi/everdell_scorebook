# Everdell Scorebook

As a player of Everdell board game I grew tired of writing the end points and summing them up by hand so I made a simple mobile app to help me store the results of every game I played.

## Functions

You can either input points when you play a game, or see all the scores on the scoreboard.

If you want to input points, you just tap on "Add new score". On the next screen you input players' names and when you are done, tap "Input scores". Input points for each player on the next screen and tap "Done".

### 2. See scoreboard

If you want to see all the logged games, tap on "See scoreboard". Basic info is displayed on each card, but you can see details if you tap on a game card. You can also sort results by date added.
